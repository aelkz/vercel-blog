### What is GitOps?

from Red Hat:

\_GitOps is a set of DevOps practices that are used to manage infrastructure and application configurations using the Git open source version control system as a "single source of truth," and is widely used with Kubernetes.

At its core, GitOps maintains that a system must have its desired state expressed declaratively, and that the desired state is versioned and immutable, pulled automatically, and continuously reconciled.

GitOps provides an array of benefits, including standardizing workflows, simplifying tool sets, reducing potential variables and errors, increasing developer productivity, and more.\_

### What is ArgoCD?

Put simply, ArgoCD is an easy to use tool that allows development teams to deploy and manage applications without having to learn a lot about Kubernetes, and without needing full access to the Kubernetes system. This hugely simplifies the process of running applications in Kubernetes, ultimately leading to better security and increased developer productivity.

### GitOps managed project

Let’s create a new GitOps project:

```
oc delete project $APP_NS ; oc new-project $APP_NS --description="Application demo managed by GitOps" --display-name="Application demo managed by GitOps"
```

Then, we create another project to deploy and configure the ArgoCD instance:

```
export ARGOCD_NS=lab-argocd
export ARGOCD_INSTANCE_NAME=gitops
export APP_NS=lab-app
export APP_NAME=app-3scale-apicast-gitops

oc delete project $ARGOCD_NS ; oc new-project $ARGOCD_NS --description="GitOps Tools" --display-name="GitOps Tools"
```

### Red Hat OpenShift GitOps operator subscription (optional)

Within OpenShift, let’s add a new subscription for Red Hat OpenShift GitOps operator.

_WARNING_: This step is entirely optional if you already have the subscription installed at openshift-operators namespace.

```
cat > subscription.yaml <<EOL
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  labels:
    operators.coreos.com/openshift-gitops-operator.openshift-operators: ""
  name: openshift-gitops-operator
  namespace: openshift-operators
spec:
  channel: latest
  installPlanApproval: Automatic
  name: openshift-gitops-operator
  source: redhat-operators
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
  startingCSV: openshift-gitops-operator.v1.5.4
EOL
oc apply -f subscription.yaml -n $ARGOCD_NS
```

### Deploy ArgoCD into $ARGOCD_NS (namespace)

```
cat > argocd.yaml <<EOL
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: ArgoCD

  name: $ARGOCD_INSTANCE_NAME

    route:

  usersAnonymousEnabled: true
EOL
oc apply -f argocd.yaml -n $ARGOCD_NS
```

### Assign role to ArgoCD service account

```
oc get sa -n $ARGOCD_NS
NAME                                   SECRETS   AGE
builder                                2         6m37s
default                                2         6m37s
deployer                               2         6m37s
gitops-argocd-application-controller   2         12s
gitops-argocd-dex-server               2         12s
gitops-argocd-redis-ha                 2         12s
gitops-argocd-server                   2         12s
```

then:

```
oc get sa ; oc policy add-role-to-user cluster-admin system:serviceaccount:$ARGOCD_NS:$ARGOCD_INSTANCE_NAME-argocd-application-controller -n $ARGOCD_NS
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin system:serviceaccount:$ARGOCD_NS:$ARGOCD_INSTANCE_NAME-argocd-application-controller -n $ARGOCD_NS
```

Global cluster write permissions (cluster-admin) is not allowed for an operator to be included in the OpenShift Operator Hub.

This is why the decision was made to ship the operator with cluster read permissions only and can be overridden by the user using the documentation referenced above if cluster-admin is something you need.

### Open ArgoCD console

```
oc get secret $ARGOCD_INSTANCE_NAME-cluster -o json -n $ARGOCD_NS | jq -r '.data."admin.password"' | base64 --decode ; ARGOCD_SERVER_URL=$(oc get routes -n $ARGOCD_NS | grep $ARGOCD_INSTANCE_NAME-server | awk '{print $2}') ; echo '\nhttps://'$ARGOCD_SERVER_URL'\n'
```

PS. oc extract secret/argocd-cluster -n $ARGOCD_NS --to=- should work too.

### Create a new application

```
oc delete Application/$APP_NAME ;
cat > argocd-application.yaml <<EOL
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: app-3scale-apicast-gitops
  namespace: $ARGOCD_NS
spec:
  destination:
    namespace: $APP_NS
    server: 'https://kubernetes.default.svc'
  project: default
  source:
    path: './20-releases/50-kustomize/lab-app/'
    repoURL: 'https://github.com/aelkz/gitops-demo.git'
    targetRevision: HEAD
  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      prune: true
      selfHeal: true
    syncOptions:
      - Validate=false
      - PruneLast=true
EOL
oc apply -f argocd-application.yaml -n $ARGOCD_NS
```

### Troubleshooting:

#### Namespace "lab-app" for Secret "3scaleportal-production" is not managed

![](/images/gitops-demo-with-argocd/002-1024x205.png)

solution:

```
oc label ns $APP_NS argocd.argoproj.io/managed-by=$ARGOCD_NS
```

then refresh and sync again on ArgoCD console.

### Check if all components was properly deployed into $LAB_NS

### Create APICast secret and SSL certificate

PS. Refer to the 3Scale documentation for creating a new APICast service token

#### Generate PKCS#8 pub and key

```
openssl req -x509 -utf8 -sha256 -days 3650 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -nodes
```

#### Convert PKCS#8 key to PKCS#1 (to use at OpenShift APICast exposed route)

```
openssl rsa -in key.pem -out key.pem
```

### See the full application deployed into ArgoCD

ArgoCD is an incredible tool for DevOps teams that wants to achieve full control of their workload. In this article, we have learned to manage the deployment of ArgoCD into OpenShift with the Red Hat ArgoCD operator. Then, it was possible to demonstrate a simple application deployment (a gateway component from Red Hat 3Scale and check if it was properly deployed and configured.
